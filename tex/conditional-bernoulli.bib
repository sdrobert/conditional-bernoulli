  abstract = {Pareto sampling was introduced by Ros{\'e}n in the late 1990s. It is a simple method to get a fixed size {$\pi$}ps sample though with inclusion probabilities only approximately as desired. Sampford sampling, introduced by Sampford in 1967, gives the desired inclusion probabilities but it may take time to generate a sample. Using probability functions and Laplace approximations, we show that from a probabilistic point of view these two designs are very close to each other and asymptotically identical. A Sampford sample can rapidly be generated in all situations by letting a Pareto sample pass an acceptance?rejection filter. A new very efficient method to generate conditional Poisson (CP) samples appears as a byproduct. Further, it is shown how the inclusion probabilities of all orders for the Pareto design can be calculated from those of the CP design. A new explicit very accurate approximation of the second-order inclusion probabilities, valid for several designs, is presented and applied to get single sum type variance estimates of the Horvitz?Thompson estimator.},

  abstract = {The distribution of Z1 +...+ ZN is called Poisson-Binomial if the Zi are independent Bernoulli random variables with not-all-equal probabilities of success. It is noted that such a distribution and its computation play an important role in a number of seemingly unrelated research areas such as survey sampling, case-control studies, and survival analysis. In this article, we provide a general theory about the Poisson-Binomial distribution concerning its computation and applications, and as by-products, we propose new weighted sampling schemes for finite population, a new method for hypothesis testing in logistic regression, and a new algorithm for finding the maximum conditional likelihood estimate (MCLE) in case-control studies. Two of our weighted sampling schemes are direct generalizations of the "sequential" and "reservoir" methods of Fan, Muller and Rezucha (1962) for simple random sampling, which are of interest to computer scientists. Our new algorithm for finding the MCLE in case-control studies is an iterative weighted least squares method, which naturally bridges prospective and retrospective GLMs.},

  abstract = {[Attention is drawn to a method of sampling a finite population of N units with unequal probabilities and without replacement. The method was originally proposed by Stern \& Cover (1989) as a model for lotteries. The method can be characterized as maximizing entropy given coverage probabilities {$\pi$}i, or equivalently as having the probability of a selected sample proportional to the product of a set of `weights' wi. We show the essential uniqueness of the wi given the {$\pi$}i, and describe practical, geometrically convergent algorithms for computing the wi from the {$\pi$}i. We present two methods for stepwise selection of sampling units, and corresponding schemes for removal of units that can be used in connection with sample rotation. Inclusion probabilities of any order can be written explicitly in closed form. Second-order inclusion probabilities {$\pi$}ij satisfy the condition \$0 {$<$} \textbackslash{}pi\_\{ij\} {$<$} \textbackslash{}pi\_i \textbackslash{}pi\_j\$, which guarantees Yates \& Grundy's variance estimator to be unbiased, definable for all samples and always nonnegative for any sample size.]},

  abstract = {Learning models with discrete latent variables using stochastic gradient descent remains a challenge due to the high variance of gradient estimates. Modern variance reduction techniques mostly consider categorical distributions and have limited applicability when the number of possible outcomes becomes large. In this work, we consider models with latent permutations and propose control variates for the Plackett-Luce distribution. In particular, the control variates allow us to optimize black-box functions over permutations using stochastic gradient descent. To illustrate the approach, we consider a variety of causal structure learning tasks for continuous and discrete data. We show that our method outperforms competitive relaxation-based optimization methods and is also applicable to non-differentiable score functions.},

  abstract = {This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},
